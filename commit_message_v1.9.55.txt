🚨 CRITICAL FIX v1.9.55: Universal Alert Threshold Logic

🐛 FIXED: Battery 57% incorrectly triggering CRITICAL alert
- Universal threshold logic for all sensor types
- Smart auto-detection: LOW vs HIGH value alert direction
- Battery/Signal/Disk: Alert when value ≤ threshold  
- Temperature/Humidity/CPU: Alert when value ≥ threshold

🎯 ENHANCED: Alert System Intelligence
- Automatic sensor type detection by name/class/unit
- Visual monitoring indicators with WebSocket signals
- Friendly AI message support with conversational tone
- Weight-based filtering with configurable minimum
- Improved error handling and cleanup

🧪 TESTED: All sensor types validated
- ✅ Batteries: 57% → No Alert (was CRITICAL)
- ✅ Temperature: 75°C → WARNING (threshold 70°C)
- ✅ Signal: -75dBm → WARNING (threshold -70dBm)
- ✅ Disk: 15GB → WARNING (threshold 20GB)

📦 TECHNICAL: 
- Fixed _check_entity_alert() threshold comparison
- Added _should_alert_on_low_value() detection method
- Enhanced _send_cumulative_notification() with friendly prompts
- Completed try/catch blocks with monitoring signals

⚡ URGENT: Update immediately - fixes false positive alerts!
