Its goal is to automatically understand which of your devices are most important for home automation.\n\nAfter this initial setup, a new \"HASS AI\" panel will be added to your sidebar. From there, you can run a scan to see how the AI has weighted your entities and then override its suggestions to perfectly match your needs. In the next step, you will configure the automatic scanning interval."
