## ⚙️ Threshold Configuration

### Per-Entity Customization
**Individual Alert Management** for each entity in your system:

**Configuration Options**:
- **Severity Level Selection**: Choose Medium, Severe, or Critical
- **Custom Thresholds**: Override default trigger values
- **Notification Preferences**: Control when and how you're notified
- **Automation Integration**: Link alerts to specific automation responses

**Entity-Specific Considerations**:
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Heating, security, safety devices → Critical/Severe
- **Convenience Devices**: Smart lights, media players → Medium
- **Monitoring Devices**: Environmental sensors → Medium/Severe
- **Safety Equipment**: Smoke detectors, locks → Critical

### Domain-Based Defaults
**Intelligent default settings** based on entity type and function:

**Security Devices** (alarm_control_panel, lock, camera):
- **Default**: Critical priority
- **Rationale**: Security failures can have serious consequences
- **Customization**: Lower for non-essential cameras or decorative locks

**Safety Devices** (smoke detector, gas sensor, water leak):
- **Default**: Critical priority
- **Rationale**: Safety devices protect life and property
- **Customization**: Rarely recommended to lower these priorities

**HVAC Systems** (climate, thermostat, heating):
- **Default**: Severe priority
- **Rationale**: Climate control affects comfort and energy efficiency
- **Customization**: Critical in extreme weather, Medium in mild climates

**Lighting and Convenience** (light, switch, media_player):
- **Default**: Medium priority
- **Rationale**: Convenience devices don't affect safety or security
- **Customization**: Severe for essential lighting, Medium for decorative

### Threshold Override System
**Flexible customization** to match your specific needs and priorities:

**Override Capabilities**:
- **Battery Thresholds**: Adjust low battery triggers per device type
- **Offline Timeouts**: Configure how long before devices are considered offline
- **Error Sensitivity**: Adjust malfunction detection sensitivity
