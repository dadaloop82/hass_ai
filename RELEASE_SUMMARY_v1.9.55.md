## ✅ **Release Completed**

### 📦 **Version Information**
- **Version**: 1.9.55
- **Release Date**: August 22, 2025
- **Commit**: `d08fec0`
- **Tag**: `v1.9.55`
- **Files Changed**: 8 files, 800+ insertions

### 🚨 **Critical Bug Fixed**

- ✅ **Universal Logic**: All sensor types now use correct threshold comparison
- ✅ **Smart Detection**: Automatic LOW vs HIGH alert direction detection

### 🧪 **Validated Fixes**
```
🔋 Battery Sensors (LOW alerts):
   57% → No Alert ✅ (was: CRITICAL ❌)
   15% → WARNING ✅
   8% → ALERT ✅
   3% → CRITICAL ✅

🌡️ Temperature Sensors (HIGH alerts):
   75°C → WARNING ✅ (threshold: 70°C)
   85°C → ALERT ✅ (threshold: 80°C)
   95°C → CRITICAL ✅ (threshold: 90°C)

📶 Signal Strength (LOW alerts):
   -75dBm → WARNING ✅ (threshold: -70dBm)
   
💾 Disk Space (LOW alerts):
   15GB → WARNING ✅ (threshold: 20GB)
```

### 🆕 **New Features Added**
- 😊 **Friendly AI Messages**: Conversational notification style
- 👁️ **Visual Monitoring**: Real-time indicators with WebSocket signals  
- ⚖️ **Weight Filtering**: Configurable minimum weight monitoring
- 🛡️ **Error Handling**: Enhanced try/catch with proper cleanup

### 📁 **Files Updated**
- `manifest.json` → v1.9.55
- `alert_monitor.py` → Universal threshold logic + monitoring system
- `ai_logger.py` → Enhanced logging capabilities
- `www/panel.js` → Frontend improvements
- `CHANGELOG.md` → Complete change history
- **New Files**: Release notes, test script, documentation

### 🚀 **Ready for Testing**

The component is now ready for installation and testing:

1. **Install**: Copy to Home Assistant custom_components
2. **Restart**: Restart Home Assistant
3. **Test**: Verify battery sensors no longer give false alerts
4. **Configure**: Optionally enable friendly messages in configuration

### 📋 **What to Test**
- ✅ Battery sensors with levels above their thresholds (should be no alerts)
- ✅ Temperature sensors with values above their thresholds (should alert)
- ✅ Signal strength sensors with poor signal (should alert)
- ✅ AI message generation (formal vs friendly modes)
- ✅ Visual monitoring indicators in frontend
